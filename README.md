# stackoverflow-popular-technologies
An animated chart creator for Stack Overflow popular techs


## Details

Wanted to get my hands on R animated bars so build this small demo.
I could've gotten the data from stackoverflow, but I scraped it. It was easier.
Scraper is build on colab, and notebook is in the project repo.

Note: Code for animation is used from this blog https://towardsdatascience.com/create-animated-bar-charts-using-r-31d09e5841da
